# Arithmetic Operators

a = 7
b = 13
c = a + b
print(c)  # Addition of a and b and then print the result.

# Assignment Operators
a = 13-7 # Assign 13-7 in a
print(a)
b = 13 # Assign 13 in b
b += 3 # Increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
b -= 3 # Decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)

# Comparison Operators

d = 5==5

print(d)
